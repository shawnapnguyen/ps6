## About the Data Set

The *US College and University Admissions* data set records the admissions rate from many colleges and universities all across the United States from the year 2020 to 2021. The data set shares the relationship of students enrollment with their ACT and/or SAT scores. Furthermore, the data set examines the number of applicants each university received and compares these numbers to the number of those admitted and enrolled into the university.

All of this information is provided under the About panel. It also includes a sample of the table from the data set that I used for this assignment.

## About the Widgets and Panels

In the Plots panel, there are two tables that show the number of students admitted within different universities in different regions of the United States.

-   The side panel includes a slider and checkbox widgets that allow the user to interact with.
    -   The user can change the range of the scores and choose which regions they want plotted on the graph, which outputs a scatter plot that displays that.

The first two reactive widgets and scatter plot displays a graph for SAT Math scores. The second two reactive widgets and scatter plot displays a graph for ACT Math scores. I decided to only include Math scores to keep the page short.

In the Tables panel, there is one table that shows important information a user would find about the US state's university/college.

-   The side panel includes a selection box that allows the user to interact with.
    -   The user can select any state that they want.
-   The main panel includes a table that calculates the average SAT and ACT math scores for each state that the user selects.
-   The textual output puts the average SAT and ACT math scores from a state into a sentence for easier readability.
